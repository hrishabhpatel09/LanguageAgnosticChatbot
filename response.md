The provided fee structure does not explicitly break down fees by academic year (e.g., '2nd year'). However, for a B.Tech student in their 2nd year, the following charges would generally apply from the 'FEE STRUCTURE FOR THE AY 2024-2025' on **Page 1**:

*   **OTHER ANNUAL CHARGES** (Applicable for all students and to be paid annually in every Monsoon Semester):
    *   Total "B" is **₹10,468** (This includes fees like Institute annual fee, Hostel management fund*, Basant, Student Insurance fee, Students Gymkhana fee, and an unlabelled fee of ₹5,000).

*   **OTHER SEMESTER CHARGES** (Applicable for all students and to be paid for the semester):
    *   Total "C" for the Monsoon/Winter semester is **₹4,100**.
    *   Total "C" for the other semester is **₹8,400**.
    *(These include charges like Medical fee, Sports subscription fee, Hostel seat rent*, Water charges*, Semester registration fee, Examination fee, Computer & Internet charges, Electricity & Maintenance charges*, and Library fee.)*

The "ONE TIME CHARGES" (Total "A" ₹13,400) are typically paid only once at the time of admission and would therefore not apply to a 2nd-year student.
